My name is Nicole Deshong and I'm from Maui, Hawaii. I was a former teacher assistant for La Petite Academy where I ensured the daily care of every child by following all licensing guidelines, created fun and interactive learning experiences, as well as communicated directly with parents about their childâ€™s overall development and success.

As an involved college student, my goal is to better myself everyday with the opportunities available to me.

I am currently pursuing a degree in Integrated Marketing Communication at Illinois State University with a minor in Mass Media. I hope to help others, make a difference, and continuously improve myself as a woman in business.
