My name is Nicole Deshong and I'm from Maui, Hawaii. I was a former teacher assistant for La Petite Academy where I ensured the daily care of every child by following all licensing guidelines, created fun and interactive learning experiences, as well as communicated directly with parents about their childâ€™s overall development and success. Working with children for the past five years has taught me how to think quickly on my feet as well as having patience no matter the circumstance. It has been a blessing being able to see every child develop their own identity. In addition, I have a background in community work which ranges from working with non-profits, foodbanks, to fundraising for youth leadership events.
